Effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on Dublin City Centre footfall
This short report will explore the effect of Covid-19 on pedestrian footfall count in Dublin City Centre through the use of exploratory data analysis. This analysis will focus on the pedestrian footfall counts of people walking past certain locations in Dublin City Centre in 2020 from January to the end of the Novemeber 2020.

All of the data was extracted from the Smart Dublin website via the Dublin City Council who collected the raw data in a csv file which we loaded in so we could produce an anlysis of this data.
